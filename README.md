Welcome to the Otago Polytechnic Software Engineering repo. This repository contains the base files, database schemas, and notes for your project.

## Basic things you should know:

- This is a Java web application
- It uses an application framework called Spring - https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/
- It is configured for a PostgreSQL database - https://www.postgresql.org/

- It uses a template engine called Freemarker - http://freemarker.org/

You don't have to know the ins and outs of all these bits and pieces, but you should understand the basics of what these frameworks are used for. Read up a little bit on the sites listed above and, most importantly, look through the existing code to get a feel for what is going on.
