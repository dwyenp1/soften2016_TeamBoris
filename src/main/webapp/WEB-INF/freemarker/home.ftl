    <p>Welcome to Freeza Pizza</p>
    <p><b><u>About the company</u></b></p>
    <p>The Freeza Pizzas journey began in 1977, in New York. Two </p>
	<p>Italian immigrants, Mr. Cacciatore and Mama Leone, opened an </p>
	<p>Italian restaurant called ‘Vienna’ on Sullivan Street, serving the </p>
	<p>locals hot, fresh pizza like they made in the old country. Vienna </p>
	<p>proved overwhelmingly popular with New Yorkers, however, </p>
	<p>the fast-paced restaurant proved too much for poor Mr. </p>
	<p>Cacciatore, who suffered a heart attack and died young. Not </p>
	<p>wanting to carry on without her husband, Mama Leone ended up </p>
	<p>leaving the business to their son, Anthony (as the story goes, </p>
	<p>Mama Leone left a note on his door, simply reading “Moved out </p>
	<p>to the country”).</p>
	<br>
	<p>Vienna continued to grow in popularity for several years, until </p>
	<p>finally it was sued by songwriter Billy Joel for infringing on so </p>
	<p>many of his songs. Vienna was forced to close its doors in 2008.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Undeterred, Anthony opened a new company, ‘Freeza Pizzas’, </p>
	<p>supplying frozen versions of his parents’ signature pizzas to </p>
	<p>supermarkets and restaurants. Anthony (along with his wife </p>
	<p>Virginia) now sell direct to customers, both online and from </p>
	<p>their factory store.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Anthony and Virginia invite you to try one of their irresistible </p>
	<p>pizzas today (with a bottle of red or a bottle of white, it all </p>
	<p>depends on your appetite!)</p>
